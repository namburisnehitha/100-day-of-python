# 100-day-of-python

Hi! I'm Snehitha, and this is my documented journey through the *100 Days of Python* challenge. I'm starting from scratch with a mission to become confident in Python and eventually land great tech internships.

##  Goal

To learn Python thoroughly through consistent daily practice for 100 days and build a solid programming foundation. This journey will help me:
Strengthen problem-solving and logic skills,
Understand Python syntax and libraries,
Build small real-world projects,
Prepare for tech internships.
